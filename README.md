# About
This is Instagram like application which is not for release or monetize.

‚ö†Ô∏è I don't upload `google-services.json` (for Firebase) for security reason. It means you cannot use this app even if you clone and run it but I'll deploy the app to somewhere soon

# Why I created this app
I created this app to show my developing skill.
I can write clean codes in Kotlin with good architecture which makes the app sustainable and testable.

I can also make beautiful layout using ConstraintLayout. I used to use RelativeLayout and LinearLayout before but ConstrainLayout is better to make efficient layout.

Instagram looks simple but it has so many features.
Obviously it requires internet connection and showing posts in list furthermore uploading image file with caption. 
They are basic features of app but you can also add more features such as uploading videos, adding filter to images if you want. 
That's why I imagined this is good theme to investigate some technologies which I've never done.

# UI Design
<img width="814" alt="sketch_design" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8979200/42127900-2419e0da-7c55-11e8-889c-e21607a0c7aa.png">

I created ui design using Sketch.
Since this app's objective is showing my skills of development, UI was not highest priority so I imitated Instagram some parts but I cared fundamental principles of Material Design.
I arranged ui design during developing so the app differs a little from the design.

# Language and Libraries
- Kotlin
- Android Support Libraries
- RxJava 2
- Dagger 2
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Picasso
- Timber
- Mockito

Kotlin is mordern language and is supported by Google as official language of Android. It's expressive, concise, and powerful. I bet that Kotlin will be standard language of Android.

In order to work with architecture, I'm using RxJava and Dagger. They enables you to write clean and readable codes.

I also wrote test codes using Mockito but I wanted to put a priority on developing features so I wrote just few test cases this time. In practical, writing test first is better though.

# Architecture

## UI Layer
UI layer architecture is MVVM using ViewModel and Data Binding from Jetpack.
ViewModel classes have some datas which is shown on View. ViewModel classes also have logics and it's not depended on other classes such as Activity, Fragment and View. Therefore it's easy to test them.
Thanks to Data Binding, I can bind data which is in ViewModel and layout(xml) without writing redundant biding codes!

## DataLayer
TODO

# Android Jetpack
![jetpack_donut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8979200/42127909-3e1d901c-7c55-11e8-8eb0-713632607778.png)

In Google I/O 2018, Google announced Android Jetpack which is a set of libraries, tools and architectural guidance to help make it quick and easy to build great Android apps.
Some of them are still alpha or beta but I love trying cutting-edged features and this is a good opportunity to do it so I tried some of them!

I wrote down what I usded through developing this app.

## Architecture
- Data Binding
- Lifecycles
- LiveData
- Navigation
- Paging (Upcoming!)
- Room (Upcoming!)
- ViewModel
- WorkManager (Upcoming!)

Data Binding, LiveData and ViewModel are great combination to manage Lifecycles.
If you use Data Binding, you can bind view and data without writing boilerplate.
Also LiveData and ViewModel cares data

## Foundation
- AppCompat
- Android KTX
- Test

## UI
- Fragment
- Layout

I used basic elements of UI component.
ConstraintLayout enables you to make flat and efficient layout.
I'd also like to use MotionLayout which is new feature of ConstraintLayout 2.0 eventually!

## Behavior
- Permissions (Upcoming!)
- Notifications (Upcoming!)

# CI and Deployment
I'll use CI for automated unit tests and deployment!

# Upcoming Features
- Permissions
- Notifications
- Filtering posts on timeline
- Cache posts using Room
- Uploading image background using WorkManager
- Paging timeline
- Refreshing timeline by pulling down
- Editing user info
- Like button
- Comment feature
- Following / Followed user
- Adding filter to image
